In our Ionic application for school admission, we've implemented seamless interaction for updating student details. With the integration of Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) functionalities, users can effortlessly fill out forms through a conversational interface. With a single click, users can engage in a dialogue with the application, providing information vocally, which is transcribed and processed. This intuitive approach eliminates the need for manual interaction, enhancing the user experience and streamlining the admission process.
